# MachineLearning

Through the MSBA program (Masters of Science in Business Analytics) at the College of William & Mary, I developed machine learning skills including regression and classification in supervised and unsupervised (including clustering and principal component analysis) settings. Models were assessed with cross validation and bootstrapping as well as other techniques. Some classification models that I've practiced are KNN, LDA, QDA, and logistic regression.  Some regression techniques include linear, lasso, ridge, generalized additive models, tree models such as random forests, partial least squares regression, and support vector machines.
