# Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence

Through the MSBA program (Masters of Science in Business Analytics) at the College of William & Mary, I developed machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques that you can become familiar with too!

For ML, these skills include regression and classification in supervised and unsupervised (including clustering and principal component analysis) settings. For dealing with high dimensional datasets, you can practice subset selection and other dimension reduction techniques. Classification models shown include KNN, LDA, QDA, and logistic regression.  Some regression techniques include linear, lasso, ridge, generalized additive models, tree models such as random forests, partial least squares regression, and support vector machines. Models were assessed with cross validation and bootstrapping as well as other techniques. 

For AI, classification and regression were performed using 'scikit neural networks' in Python.

## Application 1: Predicting Solar Production with Regression Models

includes files: KarenFfinalProj.R, finalProjectScriptSolar.R and Machine_Learning_PPT.pdf, * add AI files, change description

For this final project, my group predicted the output energy generated from small scale (commonly called 'behind-the-meter') solar arrays based soley on weather and irradiance data with no information about array size, tilt-capability or efficiency of the panels. The file KarenFfinalProj shows some of the models that I was in charge of for this project before the file was cleaned and we worked as a group to combine everything to display the best model performance. finalProjectScriptSolar shows the work that we did together in arriving at our final solution. And Machine_Learning_PPT.pdf shows our presentation.
